/**
 * A Move represents a potential move in a solitaire game. It consists of two separate concepts.
 * First there is the logical construct defining a source Element, the target Element, and 
 * constraints/properties on the card(s) to be allowed to move between them.
 *  
 *  
 * Note a UnaryMove class is a simpler concept required for moves initiated without need for
 * a terminating action. This includes (for example), flipping a card.
